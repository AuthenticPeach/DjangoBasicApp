# README Python-Django 
# Hello Future-self, Welcome back to Django
# If you are reading this, then you want to return to databases with Django.
# 1. So Django works by importing its module into your project with pip "python -m pip install django", (after step 4)
# 2. First you run the program with a 2nd powershell terminal.
# 3. We are also using virtualenv to keep things seperate, pip install virtualenv | virtualenv env
# 4. You have to activate your environment with ".\env\Scripts\activate" - Scripts is the example folder, "deactivate" ends int
# 5. To start a project - "django-admin startproject books"
# 6. python manage.py shell  | or replace "shell" with "runserver"
# 7. And then to refresh your terminal (which is mandatory), you run "exit()"
# 8. Then you retarget your project "from reading.models import Book"
